# 🌊 WAM-V Autonomous Simulator (ROS2 + Gazebo)

This is a virtual twin-hull autonomous surface vessel (ASV) inspired by the WAM-V design. It simulates autonomous waypoint navigation and basic obstacle avoidance in a marine-like environment using **ROS 2** and **Gazebo**.

Ideal for testing control logic, mission planning, and sensor behavior before deploying on a real robot.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **ROS 2 Humble/Foxy** – Robot middleware
- **Gazebo Classic or Ignition Gazebo** – 3D physics simulation
- **Python ROS nodes** – For control logic (navigation, obstacle avoidance)
- **URDF / SDF** – Boat model definition
- **RViz2 (Optional)** – Visualize sensor topics, robot state
